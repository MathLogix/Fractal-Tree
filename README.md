# Fractal Tree
A Fractal Tree is a recursive structure that visually represents the concept of fractals, where each part resembles the whole.

## Key Concepts:
- Recursion: The tree is constructed by drawing branches that themselves generate smaller branches.
- Angles and Lengths: Each branch splits into two smaller branches at a specific angle, and the length of the branches decreases with each level of recursion.
